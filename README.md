# 🩺 AI Empathy Coach: Medical Communication Training Toolkit For Medical Professional Practice

## 📖 Overview
The **AI Empathy Coach** is a Capstone Project designed to help medical professionals practice difficult patient conversations. Using Generative AI, this toolkit creates realistic, text based roleplay scenarios and provides objective, private feedback on communication skills.

Communication errors in healthcare can lead to poor patient outcomes and physician burnout. This unique project aims to solve the "training gap" by providing an on-demand, scalable alternative to traditional simulation methods.

## ✨ Key Features of this project

* **🎭 AI Patient Simulator:**
    * Simulates realistic patient personas (e.g., "John Miller," an anxious patient receiving a diagnosis).
    * Dynamic, unscripted responses based on a distinct personality and emotional state.
    * Reacts in real-time to the user's tone and choice of words.

* **📝 Automated Feedback Engine:**
    * Analyzes the conversation transcript immediately after the session.
    * Scores performance on **Empathy**, **Clarity**, and **Patient-Centricity**.
    * Provides specific examples from the chat and actionable suggestions for improvement.

* **🎬 Multimedia Integration:**
    * Includes dynamic visual avatars and sentiment-aware feedback to enhance immersion.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

* **Language Model:** Large Language Models (LLM) via API (e.g., GPT-4) for simulation logic and analysis.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Utilizes "Persona Prompting" for the patient agent and "Structured Chain-of-Thought" for the evaluator agent.
* **Interface:** (Planned) Interactive web-based chat interface.

## 🚀 How It Works
1.  **Select Scenario:** The user chooses a difficulty level and clinical context.
2.  **Engage:** The user chats with the AI patient, breaking bad news or explaining complex treatments.
3.  **Analyze:** The system processes the transcript.
4.  **Learn:** The user receives a detailed "Communication Report Card."

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is an educational prototype developed for a Master's Capstone. It is intended for training communication skills only and does not provide medical advice or diagnosis.
